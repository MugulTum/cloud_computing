Here are detailed instructions on how to run Q1:

Set Up Docker Environment:
Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. If not, download and install Docker from the official website: Docker
Once Docker is installed, open the Docker application.

Download the Dataset:
Download the dataset file yellow_tripdata_2019-01_short.csv provided for Q1. Save it to a location on your local machine.

Download the Assignment Files:
Download the assignment files provided, including q1.ipynb, the Jupyter Notebook file for Q1.

Start the Docker Container:
Open a terminal or command prompt window on your system.
Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the assignment files.

Run the following command to start the Docker container:
docker run -it --rm -p 6242:8888 -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest
This command will pull the Docker image jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest if it's not already downloaded and start a container with Jupyter Notebook running. It will also map port 6242 on your local machine to port 8888 inside the container, allowing you to access Jupyter Notebook.

docker run -it --rm -p 6242:8888 -v "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\docker123":/home/jovyan jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 6242:8888 -v "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\docker123":/home/jovyan jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest

Access Jupyter Notebook:
After running the Docker command, you will see output similar to:
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
    file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<TOKEN>
Copy the URL http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<TOKEN> and paste it into a web browser.
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser.

Upload Files to Jupyter Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the assignment files.
Click on the "Upload" button and select the files q1.ipynb and yellow_tripdata_2019-01_short.csv from your local machine to upload them to the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Run the Notebook Cells:
Open the uploaded q1.ipynb notebook by clicking on it.

Read through the instructions and code cells in the notebook.
To execute a code cell, click on it to select it and then press Shift + Enter on your keyboard.
Alternatively, you can click the "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell sequentially.

Review Output:
As you execute each cell, observe the output displayed below the cell.
Ensure that each cell executes without errors and review the output to verify correctness.

Save and Download Output:
After executing all cells and verifying the output, save the notebook by clicking "File" > "Save and Checkpoint".
To download the notebook with the output included, click "File" > "Download as" > "Notebook (.ipynb)".

Stop Docker Container:
Once you have finished running the notebook and downloaded the output, you can stop the Docker container.
Return to the terminal or command prompt where the Docker container is running.
Press Ctrl + C to stop the container.
Confirm stopping the container if prompted.


That's it! You have successfully run Q1 and obtained the output. If you encounter any issues or errors during the process, feel free to ask for assistance.
