To run Q4, you'll need to follow these detailed instructions:

Set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
If you haven't already, sign up for a Google Cloud Platform account.
Follow the instructions provided by your course or institution to set up GCP credits and create a project.

Set up Google Cloud Storage (GCS):
Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and navigate to the Storage section.
Create a new bucket where you'll store your dataset. Note down the bucket name and the path to the dataset.

Set up Google Cloud Dataproc:
Navigate to the Dataproc section in the GCP Console.
Create a new Dataproc cluster with the necessary configuration. Ensure that PySpark is included in the cluster.
Once the cluster is ready, note down the cluster name and its configuration details.

Upload the dataset:
Upload the provided dataset (yellow_tripdata09-08-2021.csv) to the bucket you created in GCS.

Access Jupyter Notebook:
Connect to your Dataproc cluster by clicking on the "SSH" button next to the cluster name in the Dataproc section of the GCP Console.
Once connected, run the command gcloud compute ssh <your-cluster-name-m> to establish an SSH tunnel to the cluster's master node. Replace <your-cluster-name-m> with your actual cluster name.
Start a Jupyter Notebook server by running the command jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://<master-node-external-ip>:8080. Replace <master-node-external-ip> with the external IP address of your cluster's master node.
You should now be able to access Jupyter Notebook.

Open q4.ipynb:
Once you're in Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory where q4.ipynb is located.
Open q4.ipynb by clicking on it.

Run the notebook:
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by clicking on it and pressing Shift + Enter.
Ensure that you have replaced placeholder values (such as bucket name and file paths) with your actual values in the notebook.
When prompted to enter your GCS bucket path in the load_data() function, provide the correct path to the dataset in your GCS bucket.

Review the results:
After running all cells, review the outputs to ensure that the functions have executed correctly and produced the expected results.

Save the notebook:
Once you're satisfied with the results, save the notebook.

Terminate the Dataproc cluster:
Go back to the Dataproc section in the GCP Console.
Select your cluster and click "Delete" to terminate it. This will help prevent unnecessary charges.
