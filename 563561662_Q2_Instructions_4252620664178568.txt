To run Q2, which involves analyzing text data using Spark NLP in PySpark, follow these detailed instructions:

Setup Environment:
Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
Download the provided Docker image for the assignment, which contains all the necessary dependencies, including Spark and Spark NLP.
Launch the Docker container using the downloaded image.

Prepare Data:
Ensure you have the text data you want to analyze. It could be stored locally or in a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.
If the data is in a cloud storage service, download it to your local machine or mount it to the Docker container.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Access the Jupyter Notebook interface by browsing to http://localhost:6242 in your web browser.
Upload the provided Jupyter Notebook file (q2.ipynb) to the Jupyter interface.

Open the Notebook:
Open the uploaded q2.ipynb notebook by clicking on it in the Jupyter interface.

Execute the Code:
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. Make sure to read the comments in the code cells for guidance.
Ensure that you have a Spark session running before executing Spark-related code cells. If not, create one using SparkSession.builder.

Load and Process Data:
If your data is stored locally, use the appropriate Spark DataFrame API to load it into a DataFrame.
Follow the provided code snippets to preprocess and clean the text data using Spark NLP annotators.
Apply sentiment analysis, identify key phrases, and perform other text analysis tasks as instructed in the notebook.

Inspect Results:
After running the code cells for each task, inspect the results to ensure they match your expectations.
Verify that sentiment scores, key phrases, word frequencies, and other text analysis outputs are generated correctly.

Save Output:
Save the final results or processed data to a CSV file or any other preferred format using the appropriate Spark DataFrame API (write.csv, write.parquet, etc.).
Make sure to specify the correct file path for saving the output file.

Clean Up:
Once you have completed the analysis and saved the results, shut down the Docker container.
If necessary, delete any temporary files or directories created during the analysis.

Submit the Output:
Rename the output file to q2_output.csv or any other specified name if required by the assignment instructions.
Submit the q2_output.csv file through the designated platform or system for evaluation.
